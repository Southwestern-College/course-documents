9. Write a class called Student with the following features

   - Private instance variables
     - `int studentId`
     - `String name`
   
   - A constructor with the header below that initializes each instance variables.
     - `public Student(int studentId, String name) //1st constructor`
   - A constructor with the header below that initializes `studentId` to `1234567` and name to `"John Doe"`. This constructor must use the keyword `this` to call the 1st constructor. Hint: you should do this in one statement.
     - `public Student() //2nd constructor`
   - Accessor and mutator methods for each instance variable.
   - A method with the header below that returns the information stored in the instance variables as a string. For example, `toString()` returns `"studentID = 1234567, name = John Doe"`
     - `public String toString()`

   **Answer**:
   ```
   x = 1
   x = 2
   ```

   **Correction**:
    

10. This problem refers to the `Student` class you wrote in the previous problem. In the `main` method:
    - Create a `Student` array with two elements and store its reference in a variable called pupils.
    - Assign a `Student` object to the element in position 0 using the first constructor. 
    - Assign a `Student` object to the element in position 1 using the second constructor. 
    - Use the mutator method to change the name of any element. 
    - Use the toString method to display the information for each object.
   
   ```java
   public class Test {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Write code here.
      }
   }    
   ```
